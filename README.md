# Welcome to my **Feedback Organizer**
This project is a feedback organizer integrated with Emotion-detection and Zero-class classification models.

# Requirements
- latest **Node.js** version

# Setup
After cloning this project, you will be presented with 2 directories representing the entire stack.

# Client 
The client side is handled by **React**, to set this up, head to the `client` directory and do:
> `npm install`

Once all the dependencies are installed, do a
> `npm start`

to run the React front-end.

# Server
The server code has been migrated to Express JS, to set this up, head to the  `server/js` directory and do:
> `npm install`

Once all the dependencies are installed, do a
> `nodemon start`

to run the Express back-end.

# Testing
The models can be tested through the **Playground**. Other than that, the Instances themselves are connected to a Firebase app making them have data persistence. To feed feedbacks to created Instances, go to **Source** and input them there.
